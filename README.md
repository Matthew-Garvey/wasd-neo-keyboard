# WASD keyboard layout with NEO layout
Designed for black keycaps (fonts in white).

## Differences to other designs
- added small QWERTY layout symbols (in case it is needed - like BIOS, new installation, ...) 
- less colourful: white for main + layer 2-4, blue for layers 5+6
- arrangement: L1 in center, L2-4 at top, L5+6 bottom right, QWERTY bottom left


# Edit-version
- fonts not converted to paths
- alignment layers (as help for symbol arrangement)
- black background layer to verify final look
- font used: mainly Source Sans Pro (should be freely available)

# Final-version
- removed unneeded layers (alignment, background color check)
- converted all symbols to paths
